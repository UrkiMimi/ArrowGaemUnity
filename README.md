# ArrowGaem
This repository is a work-in-progress port of ArrowGaem to Unity 2021. The port currently stands in a prototype phase (due to the menu and animations) but may be improved in the future for a full Alpha release.

### Roadmap
- 9/18/25: Project started
- 9/20/25: Basic game logic and temporary menu implemented
- 9/23/25: Animator logic.

## Credits
- [Easings.net](https://github.com/ai/easings.net) for easing logic.
- [PenguinMod Team](https://github.com/PenguinMod) for the engine used for the inital alpha.
